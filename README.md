# Liquid Democracy and Perceptional Competence

This is a paper I wrote along with Patrick Thornton and Lauren Cooke (both Harvard undergraduates, class of 2024) for our final project in CS238: Optimized Democracy with Professor (Ariel Procaccia)[http://procaccia.info/]. Following very positive feedback from Professor Procaccia, we are planning on continuining our work and working towards publication of a revised paper on the same topic.
